# hey! i'm althruist! ðŸ‘‹
also known as Kieran lul

i'm a student in a post-secondary college in Malta, i like game development, music, graphics, animation, and a lot other things divided in their own subcategories to put it simply.

at this stage, I'd say I'm fluent in Web (HTML, JS, and CSS) and Lua (Roblox), but I do have a pretty good concept of C# and Python; however, I don't use them as often.

Feel free to browse around my stuff! I'm soon releasing a portfolio website powered by GitHub Pages. :)
